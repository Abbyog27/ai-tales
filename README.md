## What is it?

This MERN app allows users to create illustrated stories using generative AI technology.

By leveraging the OpenAI API, AI Tales is able to take user input to create an interactive storytelling experience.

AI Tales allows users to:
* Create an account.
* Create characters with custom traits.
* Create short stories based on user prompts.
* Use DALL-E 3 to generate images inspired by these stories.
* Access their user profile for the app.
* Modify their account details.
* Delete their user account.
* Visualize content they have created.
* Explore content generated by other users.

### Pages

#### Login
![Login Page](https://github.com/soyrvelez/ai-tales/blob/main/login.png?sanitize=true)

The app's user journey begins in a login page where returning users can login or for new users to head to our signup.

#### Signup
![Signup Page](https://github.com/soyrvelez/ai-tales/blob/main/sign-up.png)

The signup page captures a user's information before creating an account for them. Once the user submits the signup form, the following validations occur:
- App checks to see if there are other users using the same email before creating the account.
- Password is encrypted before it's stored in the database.

#### Profile
![User Profile Page](https://github.com/soyrvelez/ai-tales/blob/main/profile.png)

This page displays each user's information, provides them with the tools to edit or delete their account.

#### Character Gallery
![Character Gallery](https://github.com/soyrvelez/ai-tales/blob/main/charactergallery.png?sanitize=true)

This page displays all characters created by the user.

#### Explorer Page

Social media - like feed that allows users to explore content generated by other users.

#### Learnings & Opportunities

##### Learnings
- Handling authentication with JWT.
- Leveraging third-party UI libraries in React. We used Material UI to build our app's frontend.
- Handling states to deal with asynchronous requests. Our API calls to OpenAI take a significant amount of time to resolve so we had to figure out how to provide immediate feedback to the user so they understand that the app is working.
- Nesting components and using modals to minimize the amount of unique pages needed.
- Implementing pagination in layouts where content can scale with no limit; in our case the character gallery.

##### Opportunities
- Building more social features for our Scene Card components.
- Building out a public profile page for each user showcasing their creations and allowing other users to follow them.
